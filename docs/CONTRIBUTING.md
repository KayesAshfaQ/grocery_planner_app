### 2. Fork and Branch
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/grocery_planner_app.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 3. Follow Code Standards

#### Architecture
- Follow Clean Architecture principles (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md))
- Separate concerns into Domain, Data, and Presentation layers
- Use BLoC pattern for state management
- Follow single-responsibility principle

#### Code Style
- Follow official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

#### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: `snake_case.dart`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Variables/Functions**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `lowerCamelCase` or `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for static constants
- **BLoC Events**: `VerbNounEvent` (e.g., `AddPurchaseListEvent`)
- **BLoC States**: `NounStateType` (e.g., `PurchaseListLoadedState`)

### 4. Write Tests
All contributions should include appropriate tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/path/to/test_file.dart
```

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Unit tests for use cases
- Unit tests for repositories
- BLoC tests for state management
- Widget tests for complex UI components

### 5. Commit Guidelines

Follow conventional commits format:

```bash
# Feature
